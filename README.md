# BigQuery-Workshop-From-Zero-To-Half-Hero

Welcome to this BigQuery quick and dirty somewhat Workshop!

This is intended to be a quick and simple tutorial about BigQuery; won't make you a hero but will get you somewhat half there. We hope.

To begin with, please refer to [Class00](./Class00_Setup/README.md) where we discuss basic setting up. After that, [Class01](./Class01_Arrays_And_Structs/README.md) will give you a very brief introduction about BigQuery and finally we jump into action by learning and testing concepts about the database.

## DISCLAIMER

Please keep in mind we are not in any way associated or work for Google. Also, we encourage the BigQuery community to support this repository with their ideas and what they think could be a good set of teachings and contributions for those wanting to learn more about the tool.

The structure of this repository is divided in different classes, each class is supposed to present concepts and tasks where those following through can test what they've just learned.
